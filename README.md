Abstract. The main task of this project work is to set up an object
detection to detect door handles and door knobs. For this, data must be
prepared and partitioned for a suitable deep learning algorithm before
dierent models with dierent parameters can be tried and trained. The
Project is part of the university courses Laboratory project image pro-
cessing and Laboratory project servicerobotics and lets the students work
on a real life project. This protocol sums up all work done and deals with
our general approach to solve the task, our encountered problems, some
solutions and what could be done for further improvement.
